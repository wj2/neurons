Code for simulating and visualizing neurons and networks of neurons, a somewhat
OO approach in python. 

Requires:
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib

Implemented:
- Hodgkin-Huxley, single neuron w/ visualization
- Krinsky-Kokoz reduction of HH to 2D, single neuron w/ visualization

In progress:
- Rate neurons with BCM synaptic plasticity rule, network
- Rate neurons with covariance synaptic plasticity rule, network
